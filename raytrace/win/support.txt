Windows compilation:
You will need:
(cygwin + binutils + gcc) OR (mingw + binutils + gcc) for base build
NOTE: base build is gcc -DNOSIGNALS -DNOGL -DNOJPEG
-DNOSIGNALS must be used on mingw 
(not fully supported signals when cross-compiling with wine and mingw (freebsd --> win32)
-DNOSIGNALS can be skipped on cygwin 
(and possibly on mingw from win32->win32 (windows native) - but not tested)
standard linking -lc -lm

OpenGL:
You will need: 
glut.h, glu.h, gl.h, opengl32.lib, opengl32.dll, glu32.lib, glu32.dll, glut32.lib, glut32.dll
file *.lib are not mandatory (in cygwin, don't known if they are neccesary for mingw)
if You got them You can remove -DNOGL flag and link with: -lopengl32 -lglu32 -lglut32
remember to set proper paths for includes -I, and libraries -L
also OpenGL display uses pthreads, no special switches (like -pthread on FreeBSD) are needed
cygwin seems to support fully pthread, mingw cross-compiler DONT, dont know about native mingw

JPEG:
You will need:
jconfig.h, jpeglib.h, jerror.h, jmorecfg.h, libjpeg.a (libjpeg_mingw.a)
if You got them You can remove -DNOJPEG flag and link with -ljpeg (or -ljpeg_mingw - not tested)
remember to set proper paths for includes -I, and libraries -L

Look for file in this directory, essential are there included:

If You want to setup all Yourself just install:
cygwin, coreutils, binutils, gcc, cygwin-opengl, cygwin-glut, cygwin-libjpeg, make tool

Good Luck, examples in Makefile and compile_win32.sh
